# applemusic-java

This is a personal "playground" project I am using to work on an implementation of the Apple Music REST API in Java (based off docs here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi). 

- [x] Initial data models (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/apple_music_api_objects)
- [ ] API interaction
- [ ] Token generation
